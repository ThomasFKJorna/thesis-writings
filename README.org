* Thesis

These are my notes, thoughts, and actual chapters for my (as of yet unnamed) thesis in the philosophy of science.


This will be expanded in due time. The main goal of this repository is to serve as a database for [[https://github.com/ThomasFKJorna/thesis-visualizer][the website hosting my thesis]].

Might as well give a small intro.
